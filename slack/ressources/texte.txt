#SECTION ROW 

#first row
<i class="fas fa-shapes"></i>
Conversations, organized
Instead of a single overstuffed inbox, conversations in Slack happen in dedicated spaces called channels.



#second row
<i class="far fa-newspaper"></i>
Get looped in, not out
Slack makes it simple to follow conversations or find important information in an easily searchable archive.



#third row
<i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles"></i>
Give focus a chance
Unlike email, Slack lets you choose which conversations are most important — and which can wait.
